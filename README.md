## How to play 
This game was designed to be very simple to play and user friendly.
Instructions are given along the way of what key to press to continue the game and the first letter of the input corresponds to the target word(for example S to start game).

The aim of the game is to get as close to 21 as you can without going over it. If you do you will bust and lose the hand. If the dealer gets closer to 21 than you do you will also lose.

At the start of each hand you will be dealt 2 cards. You will then be given the choice whether to hit or stand. If you choose hit you will be dealt another card, if you choose stand it is the dealers turn. The dealer has to hit until they reach 17.

Each card number is worth its value, Jacks, Queens and Kings are worth 10 and Aces are worth both 11 and 1(If you get an Ace and will be over 21 it changes to a 1).

There is also a very simple chip betting system in the game. You will start the game with 500 chips and at the beginning of every hand will be given the choice of how many chips you want to bet. If you win the hand you double the amount of chips you bet and if you lose the hand you lose all the chips you bet. If you run out of chips its game over and the game restarts.
